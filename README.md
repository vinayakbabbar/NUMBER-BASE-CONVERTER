Name:- Number Base Converter

___________________________________________________________
Description:- With the help of this converter software, you can convert any Base number to another Base number

a). I chose this project because sometimes when developers going to write optimized code for memory management then some programming languages are only based on a single number base system, in that case, binary and decimal number systems take more memory as compared to hexadecimal or octal base number system, so with the dealing of large numbers we have to use these type of converter instead of manually calculations

b). Tech Stack:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

c). I add a feature Like -  Invalid input and conversion without giving any input
